# Weather Dashboard

## Description

This weather dashboard is a functional weather tool that shows current and extended weather conditions for any city within the OpenWeather database. Inputed cities will be saved in the sidebar as buttons for quick reference. This website displays the city name, date, temperature, wind, and humidity for current weather as well as the follwing 5 days.

The purpose of this exercise was to deploy newly learned techniques for calling an API. It also reinforced local storage techniques and basic JavaScript logic.

This page is deployed on GitHub pages:<br>

## Usage

The search box is used to input a city. Once the city is found by OpenWeather, the weather for that city is displayed. For each city searched, a button under the search box with the city's name is created. When the button is clicked, it uses the weather data in the local storage to display that weather for the city.
